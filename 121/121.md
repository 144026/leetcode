Break down this problem by 'days', and Dynamic Programming can be applied. the problem is to find the relationship, between maxprofit of first $i^{th}$ day $P_i$ and that of fisrt $(i+1)^{th}$ day $P_{i+1}$.

The trick is, memoize the minimum price, and let `maxprice[i]=max{prices[i]-minprice, maxprice[i-1]}`
